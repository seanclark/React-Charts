# React Charts

Using React with Chart.js I built a page with three common charts. A Bar Chart,
Line Chart, and a Pie Chart.

The data and datesets objects allow you to change the labeling and styling to 
suit the needs of your business and what you want to report.

Each has its own animation and tool tips and can be modified and 
customize with many options.
